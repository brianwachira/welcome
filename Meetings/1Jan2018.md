Hello,

We defined our organisation as follows:
- A platform to collaborate, discuss and share our technical knowledge.

We would of course do this in the following ways:
- Website with various documentations and links to resources.
- YouTube videos explaining concepts.
- Social Media posts for publicity
- GitHub for collaboration and project sharing.

First we decided to work on a project that would "Wow" people.
We decided on [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PyWinAuto](http://pywinauto.github.io/) projects.
We work on these to have something to show off and attract people and aslo start to work on the website with the features as shown above.

Great day!
