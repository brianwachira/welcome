## Chrome browser app that numbers your tabs
- I'm a huge fan of opening multiple tabs at a go and usually I get lost in a sea of tabs that I opened. If we could make a chrome app that keeps numbers on tabs in the sequence they were opened or returns the user the tab that was used to open the tab the user just closed it would be great. I hope this is clear, I'm not sure if I explained it well. Plus I should think uploading apps to the chrome store is free so it would be a great start.
